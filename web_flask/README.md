# Web Framework and Flask

## What is a Web Framework

A web framework is a software tool that provides a standardized way to build and deploy web applications. It includes features like URL routing, templating, and database interaction.

## How to build a web framework with Flask

Flask is a micro web framework for Python, ideal for quickly building web applications. It supports defining routes, handling variables, using templates, and interacting with databases.

## How to define routes in Flask

Routes in Flask define URL patterns associated with specific functions. These functions execute when a particular URL is accessed.

## What is a route

A route is a URL pattern associated with a specific view or function in a web application. It determines how the application responds to different user requests.

## How to handle variables in a route

Flask allows dynamic routes that accept variables as part of the URL. These variables can be utilized in the associated view function.

## What is a template

A template is a file with the structure of an HTML document and placeholders for dynamic content. Flask uses the Jinja2 template engine for rendering templates and generating dynamic HTML responses.
